'''indentations in python : python uses indendation to reconize the scoop od the function and loop ex'''
    # example!
# the scoop : tells you  where the variable "belongs"
        var = 1213 # this would throw a error while runing the code because pyhthon uses identation to reconize the scoop 
    
for  i in range(10):
    print('hello world') # this statemenst belong to the scoop of for loop so we indent it
